# Revo Framework

Revo is an application framework for modern server C\#/.NET applications built with _event sourcing_, _CQRS_ and _DDD_.

## Features

The framework combines the concepts of event sourcing, CQRS and DDD to provide support for building applications that are scalable, maintainable, can work in distributed environments and are easy to integrate with outside world. As such, it takes some rather opinionated approaches on the design of certain parts of its architecture. Revo also offers other common features and infrastructure that is often necessary for building complete applications â€“ for example, authorizations, validations, messaging, integrations, multi-tenancy or testing.
Furthermore, its extensions implement other useful features like entity history change-tracking, auditing or user notifications.

[**Domain-Driven Design**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/domain-building-blocks)
Building blocks for rich DDD-style domain models \(aggregates, entities, domain events, repositories...\).

[**Event Sourcing**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/events)
Implementing event-sourced entity persistence with multiple backends \(just _MSSQL_ for now\).

[**CQRS**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/commands-and-queries)  
Segregating command and query responsibilities with:
* [Commands and queries](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/commands-and-queries#commands-queries)
* Command/query [handlers](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/commands-and-queries#command-query-handlers)
* Processing pipeline with filters for cross-cutting concerns \([authorization](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/authorization), [validation](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/validation)\)
* [Different read/write models](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/projections)

[**A/synchronous event processing**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/events)
Support for both [synchronous](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/events#synchronous-event-processing) and [asynchronous](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/events#asynchronous-event-processing) event processing, guaranteed _at-least-once_ delivery, event queues with strict sequence ordering \(optionally\), event source catch-ups, optional [pseudo-synchronous event dispatch](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/events#pseudo-synchronous-event-dispatch) for listeners \(projectors, for example\).

[**Data access**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/data-persistence)  
Abstraction layer for _Entity Framework 6_, _RavenDB,_ testable _in-memory database_ or other data providers.

[**Projections**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/projections)  
Support for read-model projections with various backends \(e.g. _MSSQL_/_Entity Framework 6_, _RavenDB_...\), automatic idempotency- and concurrency-handling, etc.

[**SOA and integration**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/integrations)  
Scale and integrate by publishing and receiving events, commands and queries using common messaging patterns,<br>e.g. with _RabbitMQ_ message queue and/or uses _Rebus_ service bus.

[**Sagas**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/sagas)  
Coordinating long-running processes or inter-aggregate cooperation with sagas that react to events<br>\(a.k.a. _process managers_\).

[**Authorization**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/authorization)  
Basic permission/role-based ACL for commands and queries, fine-grained row filtering.

**Other minor features:**
* [**Validation**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/validation) for commands, queries and other structures.
* [**Jobs**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/jobs)
* [**Multi-tenancy**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/multi-tenancy)  
* [	**Event message metadata**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/events#event-messages-and-metadata)
* [**Event versioning**](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/reference-guide/events#event-versioning)
* **History and change-tracking**
* **User notifications:** event-based, with mail/APNS/FCM output channels, supporting aggregation, etc.
* **ASP.NET support** \(ASP.NET Core coming soon...\)

## Examples

TODO
For now, see the sample Hello World application in the examples folder ([Examples/Revo.Examples.HelloAspNet.Bootstrap](https://github.com/revoframework/Revo/tree/develop/Examples/Revo.Examples.HelloAspNet.Bootstrap)) and the [reference guide](https://revoframework.gitbook.io/revo/).

## Requirements

The framework is written in C\# 7.1 and targets the .NET Standard 2.0 specification; some of its modules currently also require the .NET Framework 4.7.1 where needed \(e.g. Entity Framework 6 support\). Revo also makes a heavy use of the C\# async/await pattern and uses the TAP \(Task Asynchronous Pattern\) throughout its entire codebase \(i.e. _async all the way_\).
